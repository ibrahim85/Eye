# Eye Disease Recognition
## Introduction
Deep Learning for Eye Disease Recognition. :eye:


## Solutions
1. Apply _transfer learning_ to recognize eye disease. Namely, we first pretrain ResNeXt on ImageNet, and fine-tune on target source.
2. Apply _mixup_ and _sample paring_ for data augmentation.
3. Apply _multi-task learning_ to boost performance.


## Performance
| Model | Epoch | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ResNet50 | - | 83.75% | 67.60% | 44.33% |
