# Eye Disease Recognition
## Introduction
Deep Learning for Eye Disease Recognition. :eye:


## Solutions
1. Apply _transfer learning_ to recognize eye disease. Namely, we first pretrain ResNeXt on ImageNet, and fine-tune on target source.
2. Apply _mixup_ and _sample paring_ for data augmentation.
3. Apply _multi-task learning_ to boost performance.
